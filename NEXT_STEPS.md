# Next Steps

This document outlines recommended next steps for the ApkToolz project.

## Testing Framework Improvements

Now that we have a stable testing foundation with all tests passing, here are the recommended next steps for improving the testing framework:

### Backend Testing Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Current coverage: ~22%
   - Target: 70%+ coverage
   - Priority areas:
     - Core services: APK analysis, validation
     - API controllers: upload, analysis results
     - Worker processes: decompilation, analysis

2. **Enhance Integration Testing**
   - Add more robust API route tests with supertest
   - Create end-to-end tests for key user flows
   - Add database integration tests with mongodb-memory-server

3. **Mock Refinements**
   - Create more detailed mocks for APK analysis tools
   - Improve BullMQ mocks to better simulate queue behavior
   - Enhance validation service mocks with more realistic responses

4. **Test Utilities**
   - Create test factory functions for generating test data
   - Develop helpers for common test operations
   - Add snapshot testing for API responses

### Frontend Testing Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Current coverage: ~17%
   - Target: 60%+ coverage
   - Priority areas:
     - Screen components: Analysis Results, Settings
     - Navigation flows
     - Error states and network failures

2. **Component Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for UI components
   - Test component interactions and state changes
   - Add accessibility testing

3. **Store Testing**
   - Improve tests for Zustand stores
   - Test store actions and subscriptions
   - Add tests for persistence and hydration

4. **Mocking Improvements**
   - Enhance API service mocks
   - Add more realistic React Navigation mocks
   - Create mocks for native modules

## CI/CD Integration

1. **Test Automation**
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on push and pull requests
   - Add test coverage reporting and thresholds
   - Set up test status badges on README

2. **Test Performance**
   - Optimize slow tests
   - Configure test parallelization
   - Add test timing measurements

## Documentation

1. **Test Documentation**
   - Create examples for each type of test
   - Document testing patterns and best practices
   - Add JSDoc comments to test helper functions

2. **Visual Testing Guides**
   - Add diagrams explaining test architecture
   - Create flowcharts for test processes
   - Add screenshots of test reports

## Tools and Infrastructure

1. **Test Tools**
   - Evaluate integration of Stryker for mutation testing
   - Consider adding Percy for visual regression testing
   - Explore Jest Preview for frontend test debugging

2. **Environment Management**
   - Create dedicated test environments
   - Configure environment-specific configurations
   - Set up data seeding for test environments

## Timeline and Priority

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
- Increase test coverage for critical backend services
- Fix any remaining flaky tests
- Set up CI integration

### Short Term (1 month)
- Reach 40% backend test coverage
- Improve frontend component tests
- Create test factories and utilities

### Medium Term (2-3 months)
- Reach 50% frontend test coverage
- Complete integration test suite
- Implement all test automation

### Long Term (3-6 months)
- Reach target test coverage goals
- Implement advanced testing tools
- Complete test documentation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Regular Review**
   - Schedule bi-weekly test coverage reviews
   - Track test performance metrics
   - Identify and fix flaky tests

2. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Update testing best practices
   - Refactor tests with new patterns
   - Train team members on testing approaches
